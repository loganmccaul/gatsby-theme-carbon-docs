title: Welcome to the IBM Cloud Docs Starter
---

## Getting started

This framework is based on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), a static site generator that lets you build with React (without compromising on performance).

### Step 1: Install the Gatsby CLI

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

or

```bash
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

This utility lets you get up and running with a template (such as this one) very quickly.

### Step 2: Create your new site and give it a title

Now, you can use the Gatsby CLI to generate a new site using this repo as a template:

```bash
gatsby new my-new-docs https://github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/docs-starter
```

Once that's complete, navigate into the new directory and add a title and subtitle for your site:

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: 'IBM Cloud',
    subtitle: 'Docs Starter' // You'll likely just want to change this one
  },
};
```

### Step 3: Start coding

Head to the root of you new repo and start development:

```bash
npm run develop
```

or

```bash
yarn develop
```

Now, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see your site running locally.

### Step 4: Adding content

#### Adding a new section

At the root of our `src/` directory is a file called `sections.js` that will looks like this:

```js:title=sections.js
export default {
  books: {
    title: 'Books',
  },
  movies: {
    title: 'Movies',
  },
};
```

This file determines the top-level entries in our interior left nav. So, to add a new entry _there_, we simply add a new entry _here_:

```js{8-10}:title=sections.js
export default {
  books: {
    title: 'Books',
  },
  movies: {
    title: 'Movies',
  },
  music: {
    title: 'Music',
  },
};
```

We now have a new addition to our interior left nav, but we're not done yet. Now, we need to add a new directory with the same name as our key to our `pages/` directory like so:

```bash
mkdir src/pages/music
```

#### Adding a new page

Now that we have a new directory for our new section, we can start adding markdown files to that new directory. And through the power of Gatsby, those pages and routes will automatically be generated for us.

For instance, let's say we want to add an article about The Beatles to our new music section:

```bash
touch src/pages/music/the-beatles.md
```

Now, in `the-beatles.md` we just add a one piece of metadata (our title) and any other markdown content we want:

```markdown:title=the-beatles.md
---
title: The Beatles
---

The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960...
```

### Step 5: Going Live

One of the goals of this starter is to make it very simple to deploy your new docs to GitHub Pages, and enable automatic updates through Travis CI.

#### Create a new repository on GitHub Enterprise

If you haven't done so already, create a new repository for your docs on GitHub Enterprise. If you need help, check out [their documentation](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/create-a-repo/).

#### Set your path prefix

In order for your site to route correctly on GitHub pages, you'll need to specify a `pathPrefix` in `gatsby-config.js` based on your new repository.

```js{3}:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
  pathPrefix: '/ibmcloud/docs-starter',
};
```

> This starter lives at `https://github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/docs-starter`, so its `pathPrefix` is:
> `/ibmcloud/docs-starter`.

#### Enable GitHub Pages

Next, [create a new branch](https://help.github.com/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) for your repository called `gh-pages`, and select it as the "Source" branch under "GitHub Pages" in your repository settings.

#### Enable Travis CI for your repository

Now, head to [Travis](https://travis.ibm.com/profile) to enable Travis for your repository by clicking the toggle next to your repository on the list.

**NOTE**: If you don't see your repository in the list, you may need to click the "Sync account" button in the top right-hand corner.

Once that's enabled, you'll need to add an environment variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your repository's settings on Travis.

This token should be a personal access token for GitHub, which can be acquired from [here](https://github.ibm.com/settings/tokens/new), and should have the following permissions:

- `repo`,
- `read:org`,
- `user:email`,
- `write:repo_hook`

#### Push your code to your new repository

Finally, it's time to commit any changes and push them to the master branch of your new repository. Once that happens, Travis will trigger, and your Gatsby site will be built and copied over to your `gh-pages` branch automatically!
